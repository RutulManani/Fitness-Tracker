# Fitness-Tracker

Fitness Tracker CMS is a content management system designed to help users log, organize, and analyze their workouts, featuring a structured database with User, Workout, Exercise, and Equipment entities. Key functionalities include CRUD operations for managing workouts and exercises, progress tracking via charts (e.g., calories burned, workout frequency), and admin tools to curate exercise libraries and equipment links. The system leverages 1-M relationships (User→Workouts) and M-M relationships (Exercise↔Equipment) to enable scalable data interactions, with a user-friendly interface for logging workouts and visualizing fitness trends.
